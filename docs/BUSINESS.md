# Denty — Business Strategy

## 1. Positioning

**Denty is an AI employee for dental clinics.**

Not a SaaS platform. Not a booking widget. A digital team member that works 24/7, manages appointments, talks to patients, maintains the website, handles social media, and never calls in sick.

**The pitch:** "For less than a part-time receptionist, get a full-time digital employee that never sleeps."

**Key reframe:**
| Old thinking | Denty thinking |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Another software subscription" (€49/mo) | "A digital employee" (€199-499/mo) |
| "I need to learn a new tool" | "I just talk to it like a person" |
| "It replaces my booking system" | "It runs alongside my existing systems" |
| "Features and dashboards" | "Results and time saved" |

## 3. Competitive Analysis

### 3.1 The Real Competition

Denty doesn't compete with Doctoralia or booking platforms. Denty competes with **hiring a human**.

| | Part-time receptionist | Full-time receptionist | Denty Starter | Denty Professional |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | €800-1,200 | €1,500-2,200 | €199 | €349 |
| **Availability** | 4-6h/day | 8h/day | **24/7** | **24/7** |
| **Sick days** | Yes | Yes | **Never** | **Never** |
| **Vacations** | Yes | Yes | **Never** | **Never** |
| **Languages** | 1-2 | 1-2 | **Unlimited** | **Unlimited** |
| **WhatsApp at 2am** | No | No | **Yes** | **Yes** |
| **Patient follow-ups** | Inconsistent | Manual | **Automated** | **Automated** |
| **Website maintenance** | No | No | **Basic** | **Full** |
| **Social media** | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| **Scales instantly** | No | No | **Yes** | **Yes** |

### 3.2 vs Software Competitors

| Platform | What they are | Pricing | Why Denty wins |
|----------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| **Doctoralia** | Marketplace/directory | €150+/mo | Denty is proactive, not passive. Patients don't need to find you on a marketplace. |
| **Clínica Cloud** | Management software | €80+/mo | Denty works WITH existing software, doesn't replace it. Plus does patient communication. |
| **Miodontólogo** | Price comparison | Commission | Commoditizes clinics on price. Denty builds relationships. |
| **Generic chatbots** | Rule-based bots | €30-100/mo | Denty understands dental context, manages full workflows, not just Q&A. |

### 3.3 SWOT

| | Positive | Negative |
|---|---------|----------|
| **Internal** | AI-native architecture, dental-specific, conversational UX, low operational cost per clinic | New brand, small team, no market presence yet |
| **External** | AI adoption accelerating, clinics overwhelmed with admin, no dental-specific AI agent exists | Dentists can be tech-conservative, trust takes time, WhatsApp API costs |

## 4. Revenue Projections

### 4.1 Framework

```
Monthly Revenue = (Starter × €199) + (Professional × €349) + (Enterprise × €499)
```

### 4.2 Conservative Scenario (Year 1-3)

| Metric | Month 6 | Month 12 | Month 24 | Month 36 |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Total clinics** | 30 | 100 | 350 | 800 |
| Starter | 20 | 55 | 175 | 350 |
| Professional | 8 | 35 | 130 | 320 |
| Enterprise | 2 | 10 | 45 | 130 |
| **Monthly revenue** | €6,766 | €23,235 | €80,830 | **€194,420** |
| **Annual run rate** | €81k | €279k | €970k | **€2.3M** |

### 4.3 Key Assumptions

- Higher ARPU (€199-499 vs €49-99) means fewer clinics needed for same revenue.
- 30% convert from Starter → Professional within 12 months (they see the value).
- 20% convert from Professional → Enterprise within 12 months.
- Monthly churn: 4% Starter, 2% Professional, 1% Enterprise (high-value = sticky).
- Trial → Paid conversion: 40% (conversational onboarding reduces friction).
- Average time to first value: <1 hour (agent is operational after onboarding conversation).

### 4.4 Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **ARPU** (blended) | ~€280/month |
| **CAC** (blended) | €200-400 |
| **LTV** (24-month avg, 3% churn) | €280 × 24 × 0.97^12 ≈ €4,800 |
| **LTV/CAC** | 12-24x |
| **Payback period** | 1-2 months |
| **Gross margin** | ~85% (OpenAI API + WhatsApp API costs ~15%) |

### 4.5 Cost Structure (Per Clinic/Month)

| Cost | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| OpenAI API (GPT-4) | €15-30 (depends on conversation volume) |
| WhatsApp Business API | €5-15 (per-conversation pricing) |
| Infrastructure (MongoDB, hosting) | €2-5 |
| **Total COGS per clinic** | **€22-50** |
| **Gross margin** | **€149-477 per clinic** |

## 5. Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch & Validate (Months 0-6)
**Market**: Madrid + Barcelona (20-30 clinics)

- Direct outreach: Visit dental clinics, demonstrate Denty in person.
- Target: Small clinics (1-3 dentists) overwhelmed with phone calls and WhatsApp messages.
- **The demo**: Set up Denty for a clinic live in 15 minutes during the visit.
- Validate: Do clinics actually use it? Do patients engage? What's the retention?
- Iterate rapidly on agent quality and conversation flows.
- **Goal**: 30 clinics, €6.7k MRR, <4% monthly churn.

### Phase 2: Grow Spain (Months 6-18)
**Market**: All major Spanish cities

- Hire 1-2 dental sales reps (ideally former dental industry).
- Launch referral program: Clinic refers clinic → 1 month free.
- Content marketing: "The AI receptionist" case studies, video testimonials.
- Partner with dental associations (COEM, COEC).
- Attend dental trade shows and conferences (Expodental, etc.).
- SEO: Rank for "asistente IA clínica dental", "recepcionista virtual dentista".
- **Goal**: 100 clinics, €23k MRR.

### Phase 3: Dominate Dental Spain (Months 18-36)
**Market**: All of Spain

- Word-of-mouth should be primary growth driver by now.
- Launch Enterprise for clinic chains.
- Advanced features: AI business insights, predictive analytics.
- Build case studies: "Clínica X increased patient retention 40% with Denty".
- PR: Tech media, dental industry media.
- **Goal**: 800 clinics, €194k MRR.

### Phase 4: Vertical Expansion (Month 36+)
**Markets**: Other verticals, then international

- **Medical clinics** (dermatology, ophthalmology, physiotherapy) — same architecture, new knowledge base.
- **Veterinary clinics** — surprisingly similar workflow.
- **Beauty & wellness** (hair salons, spas, aesthetics).
- **International**: Portugal, LATAM (Mexico, Colombia).
- The agent architecture is vertical-agnostic by design.

## 6. Marketing Strategy

### 6.1 Primary Channels

**Direct sales** (Phase 1-2):
- In-person clinic visits with live demos.
- The product sells itself when dentists see it handle a real conversation.
- LinkedIn outreach to clinic owners.

**Dental industry** (Phase 2+):
- Dental conferences and trade shows (Expodental Madrid, etc.).
- Dental association partnerships and endorsements.
- Dental Facebook groups and forums (huge in Spain).
- Dental industry publications and newsletters.

**Content marketing** (Phase 2+):
- Case studies: Real numbers from real clinics.
- Video: "Watch Denty handle 50 patient messages while the clinic sleeps".
- Blog: Practice management tips, patient communication best practices.
- YouTube: "Day in the life of a clinic with Denty".

**SEO** (ongoing):
- Clinic directory pages still valuable for organic traffic.
- Target: "IA para clínicas dentales", "asistente virtual dentista", "automatizar citas dentista".
- Generated clinic websites contribute to overall domain authority.

### 6.2 The Sales Pitch

**For the dentist who does everything:**
> "You went to dental school to fix teeth, not to answer WhatsApp at midnight. Denty handles the admin so you can focus on patients."

**For the clinic manager:**
> "Your receptionist handles 40 calls a day. Denty handles 400 conversations a day. At 2am. On weekends. For €199/month."

**For the clinic owner thinking about hiring:**
> "Before you hire another receptionist at €1,500/month, try Denty for €199/month. 14 days free, no commitment."

### 6.3 Social Proof Strategy

- Record onboarding conversations (with permission) → show how easy setup is.
- Track and publish metrics: "Average clinic saves 15 hours/week on admin".
- Patient satisfaction scores from follow-up conversations.
- Google Reviews improvement tracking.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| AI hallucinations (wrong medical info) | Strict guardrails, clinic-specific knowledge only, never diagnose |
| WhatsApp API costs spike | Optimize conversation efficiency, batch messages where possible |
| Dentists don't trust AI | Start with booking only (safe), build trust, expand capabilities |
| OpenAI API reliability/cost | Abstract LLM layer, support multiple providers (Anthropic, local models) |
| GDPR/patient data concerns | Data isolation per clinic, encryption at rest, clear privacy policy, DPA |
| Slow adoption by conservative industry | Focus on time-saving ROI, not tech features. Show, don't tell. |
