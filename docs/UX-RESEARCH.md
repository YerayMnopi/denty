## Executive Summary

Denty represents a paradigm shift in dental clinic management, transitioning from traditional booking platforms to conversational AI agents. This research plan outlines comprehensive user research methodologies to validate our hypothesis that Spanish dental clinics and their patients prefer conversational interfaces over traditional form-based systems.

Our **North Star Metric** is **Patient Booking Completion Rate via Conversation** — the percentage of patients who successfully complete appointment bookings through conversational interfaces (WhatsApp, Instagram, web chat) without abandoning to traditional methods.

## UX Metrics Framework

### North Star Metric 🌟

**Patient Booking Completion Rate via Conversation: 85%**

*Definition:* The percentage of patients who successfully complete appointment bookings through conversational interfaces (WhatsApp, Instagram, web chat) without abandoning to traditional methods (phone, in-person).
